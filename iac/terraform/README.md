# Start up Guide

Generate an ssh key on your local machine using the following command:

```linux
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "ansible"
```

When prompted, enter a file in which to save the key (typically ~/.ssh/ansible) and then press Enter.

Ensure the keyfile is named **ansible**

**WARNING: ENSURE THIS KEY IS VERY PRIVATE AND DO NOT SHARE!**
